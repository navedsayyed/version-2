# Completed Work Detail View - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Made Completed Work Cards Clickable
**File: `screens/CompletedWorkScreen.js`**
- Added `TouchableOpacity` import
- Added `navigation` prop to component
- Wrapped each complaint card in `TouchableOpacity` with `onPress` handler
- Navigation goes to `CompletedWorkDetail` screen with complaint data

### 2. Created New Detail Screen
**File: `screens/CompletedWorkDetailScreen.js`** (NEW)
- Beautiful detail view for completed work
- Shows all complaint information
- Displays **both photos side-by-side**:
  - ðŸ“· **Before (User's Photo)** - Original complaint photo submitted by user
  - âœ… **After (Technician's Photo)** - Work completion photo by technician
- Shows:
  - Title, status, type
  - Location, completed date, reported by
  - Full description
  - Before & after photos with labels
  - Work completion notes (if any)

### 3. Registered Screen in Navigation
**File: `App.js`**
- Imported `CompletedWorkDetailScreen`
- Added to Stack Navigator as `CompletedWorkDetail` route

### 4. Added Auto-Refresh on Tab Focus
**Files: `TechnicianDashboard.js`, `CompletedWorkScreen.js`**
- Added `useFocusEffect` hook
- Both tabs now reload data when you navigate to them
- Fixes the issue where completed work appeared in both tabs

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Technician marks work as complete**
   - Takes completion photo
   - Photo uploads to storage
   - Database updates: `status='completed'`, saves completion photo

2. **Navigate back to dashboard**
   - "Assigned Work" tab auto-refreshes
   - Completed complaint disappears from Assigned tab âœ…
   
3. **Switch to "Completed" tab**
   - Tab auto-refreshes
   - Shows all completed work âœ…

4. **Click on any completed work card**
   - Opens detailed view
   - Shows both user's original photo and technician's completion photo
   - Can see all information about the completed work

## Features of Detail Screen

### Visual Design:
- âœ… Clean, professional layout
- âœ… Color-coded status badge (green for completed)
- âœ… Large, clear photos
- âœ… Before/After comparison
- âœ… Captions under each photo explaining who took it
- âœ… Icons for location, calendar, user
- âœ… Back button to return

### Information Displayed:
- Title and type of complaint
- Location (place + area)
- Completion date
- Who reported it (user ID)
- Full description
- Before photo (user's submission)
- After photo (technician's completion proof)
- Completion notes (if technician added any)

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Setup:
```javascript
// In CompletedWorkScreen.js
navigation.navigate('CompletedWorkDetail', { complaint })

// In App.js
<Stack.Screen name="CompletedWorkDetail" component={CompletedWorkDetailScreen} />
```

### Data Flow:
1. `CompletedWorkScreen` fetches completed complaints with `getAllComplaints('completed')`
2. User clicks card â†’ passes complaint object via route params
3. `CompletedWorkDetailScreen` receives `route.params.complaint`
4. Displays all data including:
   - `complaint.image` - User's original photo
   - `complaint.completedImage` - Technician's completion photo

### Auto-Refresh Implementation:
```javascript
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    loadComplaints();
  }, [])
);
```
This ensures fresh data every time you navigate to the tab.
