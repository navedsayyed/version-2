# ‚úÖ FIXED: Navigation Error & Added Completion Photo Database

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Navigation Error
**Error:** `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"AssignedWork"} was not handled`

**Problem:** `ComplaintDetailScreen.js` tried to navigate to `'AssignedWork'` which doesn't work in nested navigators

**Solution:** Changed to `navigation.goBack()` instead

**Location:** `screens/ComplaintDetailScreen.js` line 81

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Database Columns for Completion Photos

**New Columns Added:**
- `completion_notes` (TEXT) - Technician's notes about work done
- `completion_image_url` (TEXT) - Public URL of "after" photo
- `completion_image_path` (TEXT) - Storage path for deletion
- `completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When work was completed

**SQL File:** `supabase/ADD-COMPLETION-COLUMNS.sql`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Added New Functions to supabaseClient.js

**New Functions:**
1. **`completeComplaint(complaintId, completionData)`**
   - Marks complaint as completed
   - Saves completion notes
   - Saves completion photo URL
   - Sets completed_at timestamp

2. **`uploadCompletionImage(complaintId, imageUri)`**
   - Uploads "after" photo to storage
   - Returns public URL
   - Same folder as regular complaint photos

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run SQL to Add Columns

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

**File:** `supabase/ADD-COMPLETION-COLUMNS.sql`

Or copy this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.complaints 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_image_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_image_path TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

**Verify it worked:**
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'complaints'
AND column_name LIKE 'completion%';
```

Should show:
- completion_notes
- completion_image_url
- completion_image_path
- completed_at ‚úÖ

---

### Step 2: Reload App

```bash
# Shake device ‚Üí Reload
# Or restart Metro
```

The navigation error should be gone now! ‚úÖ

---

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Login as technician
2. Go to "Assigned" tab
3. Tap a complaint
4. Tap "Mark as Complete"
5. Click "Confirm"
6. Should navigate back **without error** ‚úÖ

---

## How Completion Photos Will Work

### User Flow:

1. **Technician taps complaint** in Assigned tab
2. **Opens ComplaintDetailScreen**
3. **Taps "Mark as Complete"** button
4. **Camera opens** to take "after" photo
5. **Enters completion notes** (optional)
6. **Submits completion**

### Behind the Scenes:

```javascript
// 1. Take photo (expo-image-picker)
const result = await ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync(...);

// 2. Upload completion photo
const { data: uploadData } = await uploadCompletionImage(
  complaintId,
  result.uri
);

// 3. Mark complaint as completed
const { data, error } = await completeComplaint(complaintId, {
  notes: 'Fixed the AC unit, replaced filters',
  imageUrl: uploadData.url,
  imagePath: uploadData.path,
});

// 4. Navigate back
navigation.goBack();

// 5. Complaint now appears in "Completed" tab! ‚úÖ
```

---

## Data Structure

### Before Completion:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "in-progress",
  "title": "AC not working",
  "completion_notes": null,
  "completion_image_url": null,
  "completed_at": null
}
```

### After Completion:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "completed",
  "title": "AC not working",
  "completion_notes": "Replaced AC filters and recharged refrigerant",
  "completion_image_url": "https://.../completed_1_123456.jpg",
  "completion_image_path": "complaints/completed_1_123456.jpg",
  "completed_at": "2025-10-06T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

## CompletedWorkScreen Now Shows:

```javascript
// Before photo (original complaint photo)
complaint.complaint_images[0].url

// After photo (completion photo)
complaint.completion_image_url

// Completion notes
complaint.completion_notes

// Completion date
complaint.completed_at
```
