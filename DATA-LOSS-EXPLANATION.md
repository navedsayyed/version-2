# üíî What Happened - Data Loss Explanation

## The Cascade Delete Problem

Your data was deleted because of `ON DELETE CASCADE` in the database schema.

### Here's What Happened:

1. **You ran SQL** that had `DELETE FROM public.users WHERE id = '...'`
2. **Or** someone deleted user from Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
3. **The database schema** has this line:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE public.users (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   ```
4. **ON DELETE CASCADE means:** When a user is deleted, **automatically delete**:
   - ‚ùå User's row in `public.users` table
   - ‚ùå ALL complaints by that user (because complaints have user_id foreign key)
   - ‚ùå ALL images for those complaints
   - ‚ùå Everything linked to that user!

---

## Why This Happened

The SQL file `update-technician-uuid.sql` had:
```sql
DELETE FROM public.users 
WHERE id = '1588362d-0609-43b0-911b-3dd079c8b20d';
```

This was supposed to delete the OLD technician account, but if you accidentally ran it with a different ID, or if the CASCADE was triggered from `auth.users`, it deleted your user account and ALL complaints!

## üîß Recovery Steps

Unfortunately, **deleted data cannot be recovered** unless you have backups. But we can start fresh and prevent this from happening again!

### Step 1: Create Your User Account Again

1. Go to your app
2. **Sign up as a new user**:
   - Email: `user@test.com` (or your email)
   - Password: `Test@123`
3. Login with new account

### Step 2: Ensure User Profile is Created

After signup/login, the app should automatically create the user profile. Check Metro console for:
```
User profile created successfully
```

### Step 3: Verify User Exists in Database

Run this SQL:
```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name, role FROM public.users;
```

Should show your new user account.

### Step 4: Submit New Complaints

1. Stay logged in as user
2. Go to User Dashboard
3. Submit a new complaint with photo
4. Check "My Complaints" - should appear

### Step 5: Verify in Database

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM complaints;
-- Should show at least 1

SELECT title, status, user_id FROM complaints;
-- Should show your new complaint
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevent This From Happening Again

### Option 1: Remove CASCADE (Safer)

Change the schema to NOT auto-delete:

```sql
-- Drop existing foreign key
ALTER TABLE public.users 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS users_id_fkey;

-- Add new foreign key WITHOUT cascade
ALTER TABLE public.users
ADD CONSTRAINT users_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (id) 
REFERENCES auth.users(id) 
ON DELETE RESTRICT;
```

This will **prevent** deleting users if they have complaints.

### Option 2: Backup Data Regularly

Use Supabase's backup feature:
- Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
- Enable daily backups

## üö´ SQL Files to Be CAREFUL With

These files have DELETE statements:
- ‚ùå `update-technician-uuid.sql` - Has DELETE
- ‚ùå Any file with `DROP TABLE` - Deletes entire table
- ‚ùå Any file with `TRUNCATE` - Deletes all rows

**Always check SQL before running!**

---

## ‚úÖ Start Fresh Now

1. ‚úÖ **Disable RLS** (so complaints can be inserted):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.complaints DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Create new user account** in app

3. ‚úÖ **Submit test complaint** as user

4. ‚úÖ **Login as technician** (technician@test.com / Test@123)

5. ‚úÖ **Check if complaint appears** in "Assigned Work"

---

## Summary

**What happened:** ON DELETE CASCADE in schema automatically deleted user + all their complaints

**Why:** Running DELETE statement or deleting user from auth triggered cascade

**Recovery:** Create new accounts and submit new complaints

**Prevention:** Change schema to use RESTRICT instead of CASCADE

**I'm sorry this happened!** üòû But we can rebuild quickly. Let's make sure RLS is disabled first, then create new data!
