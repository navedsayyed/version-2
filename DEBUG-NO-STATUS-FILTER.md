# 🔍 DEEP DIAGNOSIS - Find Why Complaints Are Empty

## What I Changed

I temporarily **removed the status filter** from the technician dashboard. 

**Before:** `getAllComplaints('in-progress')` - only gets complaints with exact status 'in-progress'  
**Now:** `getAllComplaints(null)` - gets ALL complaints regardless of status

This will tell us if:
1. ✅ Complaints exist but have wrong status → We'll see them now
2. ❌ No complaints exist at all → Still empty

## Steps to Test

### 1. Reload Your App
```bash
# In your Expo Go app:
# Shake device → Reload
```

### 2. Login as Technician
- Email: `technician@test.com`
- Password: `Test@123`

### 3. Check Metro Console

Look for these new logs:
```
📞 getAllComplaints called with status: null
🔍 No status filter - getting ALL complaints
🚀 Executing Supabase query...
📦 Supabase response:
  - Data: [array of complaints]
  - Data count: X
```

---

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome 1: You NOW see complaints ✅
**Metro shows:** `Data count: 3` (or more)  
**Dashboard shows:** Complaint cards appear!

**This means:** Complaints exist but have wrong status value.

**Fix:**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- See what status they actually have
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM complaints GROUP BY status;

-- Fix them all
UPDATE complaints SET status = 'in-progress';
```

Then change back to:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await getAllComplaints('in-progress');
```

---

### Outcome 2: Still empty ❌
**Metro shows:** `Data count: 0`  
**Dashboard shows:** Still empty

**This means:** NO complaints exist in database at all!

**Fix:**
1. Logout from technician
2. Login as regular user
3. Submit a NEW complaint with photo
4. Check if it appears in "My Complaints"
5. Login as technician again
6. Should now see it!

**Possible cause:** Old complaints were deleted, or user_id doesn't match any users.

---

### Outcome 3: Error message ❌
**Metro shows:** Error in response

**This means:** Database query is failing (permissions, foreign key, etc.)

**Share the error message** so I can fix it!

---

## Also Run This SQL

While testing the app, run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

Open file: **`supabase/FULL-DIAGNOSIS.sql`**

Or run:
```sql
-- Check if complaints exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM complaints;

-- See their status values
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM complaints GROUP BY status;

-- See raw data
SELECT id, title, status, user_id FROM complaints;
```

**Share the results!** This will confirm what's in the database.

---

## Summary

By removing the status filter temporarily, we'll see if:
- ✅ Complaints exist → Status is wrong, easy fix
- ❌ No complaints → Need to submit new ones
- ❌ Query error → Database issue to fix

**After reloading, share:**
1. Metro console output (especially the 📦 Supabase response section)
2. SQL query results from FULL-DIAGNOSIS.sql

Then I can give you the exact fix! 🎯
