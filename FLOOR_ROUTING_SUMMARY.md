# Floor-Based Routing Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

We added a **smart floor-based routing system** that automatically directs complaints to the correct department based on the floor number from QR codes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Department Mapping (`utils/departmentMapping.js`)
**Added:**
- `floorToDepartment` mapping object
- `getDepartmentFromFloor()` function

**Floor Assignments:**
```javascript
Floor 1 â†’ Civil Department
Floor 2 â†’ Civil Department  
Floor 3 â†’ IT Department
Floor 4 â†’ Electrical Department
Floor 5 â†’ Mechanical Department
```

### 2. Updated User Dashboard (`screens/UserDashboard.js`)
**Added:**
- Import for `getDepartmentFromFloor` function
- Floor-based routing logic in `submitComplaint()` function
- Priority system: QR floor routing > Complaint type routing

**Logic:**
```javascript
// If user scanned QR code with floor info:
Floor 3 QR + Any Complaint Type â†’ IT Department

// If user didn't scan QR code:
No QR + "Computer/Desktop" type â†’ IT Department
```

### 3. Enhanced UI - Category Headers (`screens/UserDashboard.js`)
**Improved styling for complaint type categories:**
- âœ… Larger, bold text (13px, weight 700)
- âœ… Primary color highlighting
- âœ… Background color for emphasis
- âœ… Left border accent (3px, primary color)
- âœ… Better spacing and readability

**Result:** Users can now easily distinguish category headers (Infrastructure, Electrical, Mechanical, IT/Technical, Housekeeping) from subcategories

### 4. Updated Documentation

**Created:**
- âœ… `FLOOR_BASED_ROUTING.md` - Complete system documentation
- âœ… `QR_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step QR code creation guide

**Updated:**
- âœ… `QR_CODES.md` - Added floor routing explanation and more examples

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: User Scans QR Code (Floor-Based Routing)
```
1. User on Floor 3 scans QR code
   QR Data: {"floor":"3","class":"305","department":"IT","building":"B"}

2. System reads floor: "3"
   getDepartmentFromFloor("3") â†’ "IT"

3. Complaint is routed to IT Department
   Regardless of complaint type selected

4. IT HOD sees complaint in dashboard
```

### Scenario 2: User Doesn't Scan QR Code (Type-Based Routing)
```
1. User manually fills form
   No floor information available

2. User selects complaint type: "Computer/Desktop"
   System uses type-to-department mapping

3. Complaint is routed to IT Department
   Based on complaint type

4. IT HOD sees complaint in dashboard
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- âœ… **Faster**: QR scan auto-fills location and routes correctly
- âœ… **Easier**: Don't need to know which department handles what
- âœ… **Accurate**: Physical location determines routing

### For Departments/HODs
- âœ… **Clear responsibility**: Each department owns specific floors
- âœ… **Better organization**: Complaints grouped by floor
- âœ… **Faster response**: Right department gets it immediately

### For Admin
- âœ… **Transparent**: See which floor triggered which department
- âœ… **Flexible**: Easy to change floor assignments in code
- âœ… **Comprehensive**: Dual routing ensures nothing falls through

## Department Structure

| Department | HOD | Floors Managed | Complaint Types Handled |
|-----------|-----|---------------|------------------------|
| **Civil** | Mr. A.G. Chaudhari | 1, 2 | Infrastructure, Building, Structure |
| **Electrical** | Mr. B.G. Dabhade | 4 | Electrical, Lighting, Power |
| **Mechanical** | Mr. R.S. Khandare | 5 | AC, Plumbing, Heating, Elevator |
| **IT** | Mr. P.C. Patil | 3 | Computer, Network, Lab Equipment |
| **Housekeeping** | Mr. Vinayak Apsingkar | All | Cleanliness, Washroom, Garbage |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Test Floor 1 QR Code**
  - Scan floor 1 QR code
  - Submit complaint
  - Verify it appears in Civil HOD dashboard

- [ ] **Test Floor 3 QR Code**
  - Scan floor 3 QR code
  - Submit complaint
  - Verify it appears in IT HOD dashboard

- [ ] **Test Floor 4 QR Code**
  - Scan floor 4 QR code
  - Submit complaint
  - Verify it appears in Electrical HOD dashboard

- [ ] **Test Floor 5 QR Code**
  - Scan floor 5 QR code
  - Submit complaint
  - Verify it appears in Mechanical HOD dashboard

- [ ] **Test Without QR Code**
  - Don't scan any QR code
  - Select "Computer/Desktop" type
  - Verify it appears in IT HOD dashboard (type-based routing)

- [ ] **Test Category Headers**
  - Open complaint type dropdown
  - Verify category headers are highlighted and easy to spot
  - Check: Infrastructure, Electrical, Mechanical, IT/Technical, Housekeeping, Other

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Generate QR Codes
Use `QR_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` to create QR codes for each room:
- Floor 1 rooms â†’ Civil department QR codes
- Floor 3 rooms â†’ IT department QR codes  
- Floor 4 rooms â†’ Electrical department QR codes
- Floor 5 rooms â†’ Mechanical department QR codes

### 2. Print and Post QR Codes
- Print QR codes (4x4 inches recommended)
- Laminate for durability
- Post at eye level near room entrances

### 3. Train Users
- Show users the QR scan feature
- Demonstrate how it auto-fills location
- Explain that floor determines department

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- Check if complaints are routing correctly
- Adjust floor-to-department mappings if needed
- Add new floors as building expands

## Configuration

To change floor assignments, edit `utils/departmentMapping.js`:

```javascript
export const floorToDepartment = {
  '1': 'Civil',          // Change to different department if needed
  '2': 'Civil',          
  '3': 'IT',             
  '4': 'Electrical',     
  '5': 'Mechanical',
  '6': 'Housekeeping',   // Add new floors
  '7': 'Civil',          // Add more as needed
};
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `utils/departmentMapping.js` - Added floor mapping
2. âœ… `screens/UserDashboard.js` - Added floor routing logic + UI improvements
3. âœ… `QR_CODES.md` - Updated with floor routing docs
4. âœ… `FLOOR_BASED_ROUTING.md` - NEW: Complete system documentation
5. âœ… `QR_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` - NEW: QR code creation guide

## Technical Details

**Priority System:**
```
1. Floor-based routing (if QR code scanned with floor data)
   â†“
2. Type-based routing (if no floor data)
   â†“
3. Default to General (if no routing info)
```

**Code Location:**
```javascript
// In UserDashboard.js, submitComplaint function:
if (complaintForm.floor) {
  const floorBasedDept = getDepartmentFromFloor(complaintForm.floor);
  if (floorBasedDept) {
    routingDepartment = floorBasedDept; // Use floor-based routing
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The floor-based routing system is now fully implemented and provides:
- âœ… Smarter complaint routing based on physical location
- âœ… Better organization by floor and department
- âœ… Enhanced user experience with highlighted category headers
- âœ… Dual routing system (floor-based + type-based)
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation for deployment

**Status:** Ready for testing and deployment! ðŸš€
