# Implementation Summary - HOD Dashboard Tab Logic Update

## ✅ What Was Changed

### File Modified
`screens/AdminDashboard.js`

### Function Updated
`getFilteredComplaints()`

---

## 🔧 Code Changes

### BEFORE (Old Logic)
```javascript
const getFilteredComplaints = () => {
  let filtered = [...complaints];

  if (complaintFilter === 'technicians') {
    // Showed only assigned complaints
    const techIds = technicians.map(t => t.id);
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => c.assigned_to && techIds.includes(c.assigned_to));
  }
  // Department tab showed everything else
}
```

### AFTER (New Logic)
```javascript
const getFilteredComplaints = () => {
  const { getDepartmentForComplaintType } = require('../utils/departmentMapping');
  let filtered = [...complaints];

  if (complaintFilter === 'department') {
    // DEPARTMENT TAB: Show ONLY floor-based complaints (QR code scans)
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => c.department === hodProfile?.department);
  } 
  else if (complaintFilter === 'technicians') {
    // MY TECHNICIANS TAB: Show ONLY type-based complaints (complaint type matches)
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => {
      const mappedDept = getDepartmentForComplaintType(c.type);
      return mappedDept === hodProfile?.department;
    });
  }
}
```

## 📊 New Behavior

### Department Tab
**Shows:** Floor-based complaints ONLY  
**Filter:** `complaint.department === hodDepartment`  
**Source:** QR code scans with floor information

**Example - Civil HOD:**
- ✅ Floor 1 + Any type → Shows
- ✅ Floor 2 + Any type → Shows
- ❌ Manual entry + Civil type → Doesn't show
- ❌ Floor 3 + Any type → Doesn't show

### My Technicians Tab
**Shows:** Type-based complaints ONLY  
**Filter:** `getDepartmentForComplaintType(complaint.type) === hodDepartment`  
**Source:** Any floor, based on complaint type

**Example - Civil HOD:**
- ✅ Any floor + Infrastructure → Shows
- ✅ Any floor + Wall/Furniture → Shows
- ❌ Floor 1 + Computer → Doesn't show (type = IT)
- ❌ Floor 2 + AC → Doesn't show (type = Mechanical)

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Computer Problem on Floor 1

**Submission:**
```
QR Code: Floor 1 (Civil's floor)
Type: Computer/Desktop (IT type)
```

**Routing:**
```
complaint.department = "Civil"  (from Floor 1)
complaint.type = "computer"     (maps to IT)
```

**Visibility:**
```
Civil HOD:
  Department Tab: ✅ Shows (Floor 1)
  My Technicians: ❌ Hidden (IT type)

IT HOD:
  Department Tab: ❌ Hidden (Floor 1 = Civil)
  My Technicians: ✅ Shows (Computer type)
```

**Result:** 
- Civil HOD handles floor responsibility
- IT HOD can provide technical support
- Clear separation of duties

---

### Scenario 2: Wall Damage (Manual Entry, No QR)

**Submission:**
```
QR Code: NOT scanned
Type: Wall/Paint Damage (Civil type)
Location: Manually entered "Floor 3"
```

**Routing:**
```
complaint.department = null     (no QR scan)
complaint.type = "wall"         (maps to Civil)
```

**Visibility:**
```
Civil HOD:
  Department Tab: ❌ Hidden (no QR department field)
  My Technicians: ✅ Shows (Wall = Civil type)

IT HOD:
  Department Tab: ❌ Hidden (no Floor 3 QR scan)
  My Technicians: ❌ Hidden (Wall = Civil type)
```

**Result:**
- Civil HOD handles based on problem type
- Encourages users to scan QR codes for better tracking

---

### Scenario 3: Wall Damage on Floor 1 (QR Scanned)

**Submission:**
```
QR Code: Floor 1 (Civil's floor)
Type: Wall/Paint Damage (Civil type)
```

**Routing:**
```
complaint.department = "Civil"  (from Floor 1)
complaint.type = "wall"         (maps to Civil)
```

**Visibility:**
```
Civil HOD:
  Department Tab: ✅ Shows (Floor 1)
  My Technicians: ✅ Shows (Wall type)

OTHER HODs:
  Both tabs: ❌ Hidden
```

**Result:**
- Civil HOD sees complaint in BOTH tabs
- Both floor AND type responsibility match
- Double visibility for clear ownership

## 📋 Benefits

### ✅ Clear Separation of Duties
- **Department Tab** = Physical location responsibility
- **My Technicians Tab** = Technical expertise responsibility

### ✅ Better Organization
- HODs know exactly which floors they manage
- HODs know which problem types their team handles
- No confusion about responsibilities

### ✅ Efficient Coordination
- Floor-based issues visible to floor manager
- Type-based issues visible to technical expert
- Easy to coordinate when both are needed

### ✅ Encourages QR Code Usage
- Floor-based complaints only show with QR scan
- Users see benefit of scanning QR codes
- Better location tracking and routing

1. Login as user
2. Scan Floor 1 QR code
3. Select "Computer/Desktop" type
4. Submit complaint
5. Login as Civil HOD → Check **Department Tab** → ✅ Should see it
6. Login as Civil HOD → Check **My Technicians Tab** → ❌ Should NOT see it
7. Login as IT HOD → Check **My Technicians Tab** → ✅ Should see it

### Test 2: Type-Based Routing (My Technicians Tab)
1. Login as user
2. Do NOT scan QR code
3. Manually enter "Floor 5, Room 502"
4. Select "Furniture Repair" type

## 🎯 Summary

| Tab | Filter | Shows | Example (Civil HOD) |
|-----|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Department** | `complaint.department === "Civil"` | Floor-based (QR only) | Floor 1 & 2 complaints |
| **My Technicians** | `complaint_type → "Civil"` | Type-based (any floor) | Infrastructure/Wall/Furniture |

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented and Ready for Testing!**

The HOD Dashboard now has clear separation:
- **Department Tab** = "Problems on MY floors" (QR-based)
- **My Technicians Tab** = "Problems MY team fixes" (Type-based)
