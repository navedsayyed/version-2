# HOD Dashboard Update Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
The HOD Dashboard "Department" tab was using incorrect query logic:
```javascript
// OLD (INCORRECT):
.eq('complaint_type', department)  // Only checked type, ignored floor-based routing
```

### Solution
Updated to support **dual routing system** (floor-based + type-based):
```javascript
// NEW (CORRECT):
1. Get all complaints
2. Filter by department field (floor-based routing from QR)
3. OR filter by complaint type mapping (type-based routing)
4. Show complaints that match EITHER condition
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Department Tab - Shows ALL Department Complaints

**Civil Department HOD sees:**
- ✅ All Floor 1 complaints (any type) - Floor-based
- ✅ All Floor 2 complaints (any type) - Floor-based
- ✅ All "Infrastructure" type complaints (any floor) - Type-based
- ✅ All "Wall/Paint/Furniture" etc. complaints (any floor) - Type-based

**IT Department HOD sees:**
- ✅ All Floor 3 complaints (any type) - Floor-based
- ✅ All "Computer/Network/Projector" etc. complaints (any floor) - Type-based

**Electrical Department HOD sees:**
- ✅ All Floor 4 complaints (any type) - Floor-based
- ✅ All "Electrical/Lighting/Power" etc. complaints (any floor) - Type-based

**Mechanical Department HOD sees:**
- ✅ All Floor 5 complaints (any type) - Floor-based
- ✅ All "AC/Plumbing/Heating" etc. complaints (any floor) - Type-based

---

### My Technicians Tab - Shows ONLY Assigned Complaints

**What HOD Sees:**
- ✅ Complaints assigned to ANY technician in their department
- ✅ Technician name shown for each complaint
- ✅ Both in-progress and completed assignments
- ❌ Unassigned complaints (only in Department tab)
- ❌ Complaints assigned to other departments

**Example:**
```
Civil HOD's My Technicians Tab:
├─ Suresh Kumar (Civil Technician):
│  ├─ Wall repair (Floor 1) - In-Progress
│  └─ Ceiling fix (Floor 2) - Completed
│
└─ Ramesh Patil (Civil Technician):
   └─ Door repair (Floor 1) - In-Progress

Total: 3 assigned complaints
Note: 5 more unassigned complaints in Department tab
```

---

## Code Changes

### File Modified
`screens/AdminDashboard.js`

### Function Updated
`loadComplaints(department)`

**Changes:**
1. Fetch all complaints instead of filtering by complaint_type
2. Import `getDepartmentForComplaintType` utility
3. Filter complaints using BOTH conditions:
   - `complaint.department === department` (floor-based)
   - `getDepartmentForComplaintType(complaint.type) === department` (type-based)
4. Return complaints that match EITHER condition

**Result:**
- HOD now sees complaints from their floors (QR-based)
- HOD also sees complaints of their types (manual entry)
- Dual routing system fully functional

## Routing Logic Explained

### Priority System

```
1️⃣ HIGHEST PRIORITY: Floor-Based Routing (QR Code)
   └─ Floor 3 QR scanned → IT Department (regardless of type)

2️⃣ FALLBACK: Type-Based Routing (Manual Entry)
   └─ "Computer" type selected → IT Department (if no floor info)
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: QR Code Scanned
```
User Action:
├─ Scans Floor 3 QR code
├─ Selects "Furniture Repair" (normally Civil type)
└─ Submits complaint

Routing:
├─ Floor 3 detected
├─ Floor 3 → IT Department
└─ IT HOD sees complaint in Department tab

Result:
✅ IT HOD Dashboard (Floor 3 = IT's floor)
❌ Civil HOD Dashboard (even though it's furniture)
```

#### Scenario 2: Manual Entry (No QR)
```
User Action:
├─ Doesn't scan QR code
├─ Manually enters "Floor 3, Room 305"
├─ Selects "Furniture Repair"
└─ Submits complaint

Routing:
├─ No floor data in complaint.department
├─ Falls back to type-based routing
├─ "Furniture" → Civil Department
└─ Civil HOD sees complaint in Department tab

Result:
✅ Civil HOD Dashboard (Furniture = Civil type)
❌ IT HOD Dashboard (no floor routing data)

Note: This shows the importance of QR codes!
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Floor-Based Routing
- [ ] Civil HOD logs in
- [ ] Submits test complaint with Floor 1 QR code (any type)
- [ ] Verify complaint appears in Civil HOD's Department tab
- [ ] Verify complaint does NOT appear in other HODs' tabs

### Test 2: Type-Based Routing
- [ ] Submit complaint without QR code
- [ ] Select "Computer/Desktop" type
- [ ] Verify complaint appears in IT HOD's Department tab
- [ ] Verify complaint does NOT appear in other HODs' tabs

### Test 3: My Technicians Tab
- [ ] HOD assigns complaint to technician
- [ ] Check Department tab: ✅ complaint still shows
- [ ] Check My Technicians tab: ✅ complaint NOW shows
- [ ] Verify unassigned complaints DON'T show in My Technicians tab

### Test 4: Dual Routing Priority

## Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Department Tab** | Only type-based routing | Floor-based + Type-based |
| **Floor Complaints** | ❌ Not captured | ✅ Captured from QR codes |
| **QR Code Routing** | ❌ Not working | ✅ Fully functional |
| **Dual Routing** | ❌ Single method | ✅ Two methods (priority system) |
