# HOD Dashboard - Corrected Tab Logic

## ✅ NEW BEHAVIOR (Implemented)

### **Department Tab** 
Shows **ONLY floor-based complaints** (from QR code scans)

### **My Technicians Tab**
Shows **ONLY type-based complaints** (based on complaint type, from any floor)

---

## How It Works Now

### 🏢 **Department Tab** - Floor-Based Complaints Only

**What HOD Sees:**
- ✅ Complaints where `complaint.department` field matches their department
- ✅ These come from QR code scans with floor information
- ❌ Does NOT show type-based complaints

**Civil Department HOD sees:**
```
Department Tab:
├─ All Floor 1 complaints (any type) - from QR codes
└─ All Floor 2 complaints (any type) - from QR codes

Examples:
✅ Floor 1 + Computer issue → Shows here (Floor 1 = Civil's floor)
✅ Floor 1 + Furniture → Shows here
✅ Floor 2 + AC problem → Shows here
❌ Floor 3 + Wall damage → Doesn't show (Floor 3 = IT's floor)
❌ Manual entry + Infrastructure → Doesn't show (no QR, goes to My Technicians)
```

**IT Department HOD sees:**
```
Department Tab:
└─ All Floor 3 complaints (any type) - from QR codes

Examples:
✅ Floor 3 + Computer → Shows here
✅ Floor 3 + Furniture → Shows here
✅ Floor 3 + AC problem → Shows here
❌ Floor 1 + Computer → Doesn't show (Floor 1 = Civil's floor)
❌ Manual entry + Computer → Doesn't show (no QR, goes to My Technicians)
```

**Electrical Department HOD sees:**
```
Department Tab:
└─ All Floor 4 complaints (any type) - from QR codes
```

**Mechanical Department HOD sees:**
```
Department Tab:
└─ All Floor 5 complaints (any type) - from QR codes
```

---

### 👥 **My Technicians Tab** - Type-Based Complaints Only

**What HOD Sees:**
- ✅ Complaints where complaint type maps to their department
- ✅ These come from ANY floor (or manual entry without QR)
- ❌ Does NOT show floor-based complaints (unless type also matches)

**Civil Department HOD sees:**
```
My Technicians Tab:
├─ All "Infrastructure" type (any floor)
├─ All "Wall/Paint" type (any floor)
├─ All "Furniture" type (any floor)
├─ All "Building Structure" type (any floor)
└─ All other Civil-related types (any floor)

Examples:
✅ Manual entry + Infrastructure → Shows here
✅ Floor 5 + Furniture → Shows here (type = Civil)
✅ Floor 3 + Wall damage → Shows here (type = Civil)
❌ Floor 1 + Computer → Doesn't show (type = IT, shows in Department tab)
❌ Floor 2 + AC → Doesn't show (type = Mechanical, shows in Department tab)
```

**IT Department HOD sees:**
```
My Technicians Tab:
├─ All "Computer/Desktop" type (any floor)
├─ All "Network" type (any floor)
├─ All "Projector" type (any floor)
├─ All "Lab Equipment" type (any floor)
└─ All other IT-related types (any floor)

Examples:
✅ Manual entry + Computer → Shows here
✅ Floor 1 + Network issue → Shows here (type = IT)
✅ Floor 5 + Projector → Shows here (type = IT)
❌ Floor 3 + Furniture → Doesn't show (type = Civil, shows in Department tab)
```

**Electrical Department HOD sees:**
```
My Technicians Tab:
├─ All "Electrical Wiring" type (any floor)
├─ All "Lighting" type (any floor)
├─ All "Power" type (any floor)
└─ All other Electrical-related types (any floor)
```

**Mechanical Department HOD sees:**
```
My Technicians Tab:
├─ All "Air Conditioning" type (any floor)
├─ All "Plumbing" type (any floor)
├─ All "Heating" type (any floor)
└─ All other Mechanical-related types (any floor)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Computer Problem on Floor 1

**User Action:**
- Scans Floor 1 QR code
- Selects "Computer/Desktop" type
- Submits complaint

**Routing:**
- `complaint.department` = "Civil" (Floor 1 → Civil)
- `complaint.type` = "computer" (Computer → IT)

**Who Sees It:**
```
Civil HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ✅ Shows (Floor 1 = Civil's floor)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (type = IT, not Civil)

IT HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (Floor 1 = Civil's floor)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ✅ Shows (type = Computer = IT)
```

**Result:**
- Civil HOD handles it (Floor 1 is their responsibility)
- OR Civil HOD can coordinate with IT HOD
- IT HOD can see it's a computer issue in their "My Technicians" tab

---

### Example 2: Furniture Problem (Manual Entry, No QR)

**User Action:**
- Does NOT scan QR code
- Manually enters "Floor 3, Room 305"
- Selects "Furniture Repair" type
- Submits complaint

**Routing:**
- `complaint.department` = null (no QR scan)
- `complaint.type` = "furniture" (Furniture → Civil)

**Who Sees It:**
```
Civil HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (no department field)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ✅ Shows (type = Furniture = Civil)

IT HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (no Floor 3 QR scan)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (type = Civil, not IT)
```

**Result:**
- Civil HOD sees it in "My Technicians" tab (type-based)
- IT HOD doesn't see it at all (not their floor, not their type)

---

### Example 3: AC Problem on Floor 3 (QR Scanned)

**User Action:**
- Scans Floor 3 QR code
- Selects "Air Conditioning" type
- Submits complaint

**Routing:**
- `complaint.department` = "IT" (Floor 3 → IT)
- `complaint.type` = "ac" (AC → Mechanical)

**Who Sees It:**
```
IT HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ✅ Shows (Floor 3 = IT's floor)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (type = Mechanical, not IT)

Mechanical HOD:
├─ Department Tab: ❌ Doesn't show (Floor 3 = IT's floor)
└─ My Technicians Tab: ✅ Shows (type = AC = Mechanical)
```

**Result:**
- IT HOD sees it in "Department" tab (Floor 3 responsibility)
- Mechanical HOD sees it in "My Technicians" tab (AC type)
- IT HOD can coordinate with Mechanical HOD for AC specialist

---

## Clear Separation of Responsibilities

### Department Tab = Physical Location Responsibility
```
"These are complaints from MY FLOORS"
├─ I'm responsible for this physical space
├─ I see ALL issues in my area (any type)
└─ I coordinate with other departments if needed
```

### My Technicians Tab = Problem Type Expertise
```
"These are complaints MY TEAM can handle"
├─ I have expertise in this problem type
├─ I can assign to my specialized technicians
└─ Issues can be from any floor in the building
```

---

## Code Logic

### loadComplaints() - Gets ALL Department Complaints
```javascript
// Loads complaints from BOTH sources:
1. Floor-based (department field matches)
2. Type-based (complaint type maps to department)
```

### getFilteredComplaints() - Splits by Tab
```javascript
if (complaintFilter === 'department') {
  // DEPARTMENT TAB: Show ONLY floor-based
  filtered = complaints where complaint.department === hodDepartment
}
else if (complaintFilter === 'technicians') {
  // MY TECHNICIANS TAB: Show ONLY type-based
  filtered = complaints where complaint_type maps to hodDepartment
}
```

---

## Summary Table

| Tab | Shows | Filter Logic | Example (Civil HOD) |
|-----|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Department** | Floor-based complaints | `complaint.department === "Civil"` | Floor 1 & 2 complaints (any type) |
| **My Technicians** | Type-based complaints | `complaint_type → "Civil"` | Infrastructure/Wall/Furniture (any floor) |
