# ✅ Image Upload Fix & Setup Guide

## 🐛 The Problem
Error: `Property 'blob' doesn't exist` - This happened because React Native doesn't support the `blob()` method like web browsers do.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fixed `uploadComplaintImage` Function
Changed from using `.blob()` to using `arrayBuffer()` which works in React Native:

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(imageUri);
const blob = await response.blob(); // ❌ Doesn't work in React Native
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(imageUri);
const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer(); // ✅ Works in React Native
const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
```

## 🔧 CRITICAL: Storage Bucket Setup

### You MUST create the storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://app.supabase.com/project/oeazkkxhvmmthysjdklk/storage/buckets

2. **Create Storage Bucket**
   - Click **"New bucket"**
   - Name: `complaint-images`
   - Public bucket: ✅ **YES** (Important!)
   - File size limit: 5MB (or your preference)
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png`

3. **Click "Create bucket"**

### ⚠️ Without this bucket, image upload will fail!

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Create the Storage Bucket (if not done)
Follow the steps above first!

### 2. Test Image Upload
1. Open your app
2. Go to "New Complaint"
3. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test with Image"
   - Type: Any type
   - Location: "Test Location"
   - Place: "Test Place"
   - Description: "Testing image upload"

4. **Add a Photo:**
   - Click "Add Photo"
   - Take a photo OR pick from gallery
   - You should see the image preview ✅

5. **Submit the Complaint:**
   - Click "Submit Complaint"
   - Wait for success message
   - Should say "Submitted!" ✅

### 3. Verify in Supabase Dashboard

**Check Complaint Created:**
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/oeazkkxhvmmthysjdklk/editor
2. Click on **"complaints"** table
3. You should see your new complaint ✅

**Check Image Uploaded:**
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/oeazkkxhvmmthysjdklk/storage/buckets/complaint-images
2. Open **"complaints"** folder
3. You should see your uploaded image (format: `{id}_{timestamp}.jpg`) ✅

**Check Image Record:**
1. Go to **Table Editor**
2. Click on **"complaint_images"** table
3. You should see a row with:
   - `complaint_id`: ID of your complaint
   - `url`: Public URL to the image
   - `storage_path`: Path in storage ✅

## 🎯 What Changed

### File: `config/supabaseClient.js`

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Use `arrayBuffer()` instead of `blob()`
2. ✅ Convert to `Uint8Array` for Supabase
3. ✅ Added proper `contentType` header
4. ✅ Better error logging
5. ✅ React Native compatible approach

## 📋 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Bucket not found"
**Solution:** Create the `complaint-images` bucket in Supabase Dashboard (see steps above)

### Error: "Failed to upload"
**Solution:** 
- Check bucket is **Public** ✅
- Check file size < 5MB
- Check internet connection

### Error: "Failed to insert image record"
**Solution:**
- Verify `complaint_images` table exists
- Check SQL schema was run correctly
- Verify RLS policies allow INSERT

### Image uploads but doesn't show in list
**Solution:**
- Check `getComplaints` query includes `complaint_images` join
- Verify image URL is correct

## ✨ Features Now Working

1. ✅ **Take Photo** - Camera opens, photo captured
2. ✅ **Pick from Gallery** - Image picker works
3. ✅ **Image Preview** - Shows selected image before submit
4. ✅ **Upload to Supabase** - Stores in cloud storage
5. ✅ **Save to Database** - Creates record in complaint_images table
6. ✅ **Display in List** - Shows images in "My Complaints"

## 🔐 Security Note

The storage bucket is set to **Public** so images can be viewed without authentication. This is fine for complaint images, but if you need private images:

1. Set bucket to **Private**
2. Add Storage RLS policies
3. Use `createSignedUrl()` instead of `getPublicUrl()`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Create storage bucket** (if not done)
2. ✅ **Test image upload**
3. ✅ **Verify in Supabase Dashboard**
4. ✅ **Check "My Complaints" shows image**

## 📝 File Upload Format

Your images are stored as:
```
complaint-images/
  └── complaints/
      ├── 1_1234567890.jpg
      ├── 2_1234567891.png
      └── 3_1234567892.jpg
```

Format: `{complaintId}_{timestamp}.{extension}`

## 🎊 Status

**Image Upload**: ✅ FIXED!

The error is resolved. Just make sure you've created the storage bucket in Supabase, and image uploads will work perfectly!
