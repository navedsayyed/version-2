# 🎉 HOD System Implementation - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Department Mapping System** 🗺️
- **File:** `utils/departmentMapping.js`
- **Purpose:** Automatically routes complaints to the correct HOD based on complaint type
- **Mapping:**
  - Civil → Wall, Ceiling, Floor, Door, Window
  - Electrical → Electrical, Lighting, Power, AC, Heating
  - Mechanical → Plumbing, Furniture
  - IT → Network, Computer, Projector, Lab, Teaching
  - Housekeeping → Cleanliness, Security

### 2. **Automatic Complaint Routing** 🚀
- **File:** `config/supabaseClient.js` (Updated `createComplaint()` function)
- **How it works:**
  1. User selects complaint type (e.g., "Electrical")
  2. System maps it to department using `departmentMapping.js`
  3. Complaint is stored with `complaint_type = "Electrical"`
  4. Only Electrical HOD sees this complaint

### 3. **HOD Profile Setup Scripts** 📋
- **File:** `database/setup_hod_profiles.sql`
- **Creates 5 HOD profiles:**
  1. Mr. A.G. Chaurdhari (Civil)
  2. Mr. B.G. Dabhade (Electrical)
  3. Mr. R.S. Khandare (Mechanical)
  4. Mr. P.C. Patil (IT)
  5. Mr. Vinayak Apsingkar (Housekeeping)

### 4. **Technician Setup Scripts** 👷
- **File:** `database/setup_technicians.sql`
- **Creates 12 technician profiles:**
  - Civil: 2 technicians
  - Electrical: 3 technicians
  - Mechanical: 2 technicians
  - IT: 3 technicians
  - Housekeeping: 2 technicians

### 5. **Dashboard Already Configured** ✅
- **File:** `screens/AdminDashboard.js`
- **Already implements:**
  - Filters complaints by `complaint_type = department`
  - Filters technicians by `department`
  - Shows only department-specific data
  - Department/Technicians filter toggle
  - Status dropdown (All/Pending/Completed)

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Create HOD Accounts in Supabase
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add User" for each HOD:
   - ag.chaurdhari@college.edu
   - bg.dabhade@college.edu
   - rs.khandare@college.edu
   - pc.patil@college.edu
   - vinayak.apsingkar@college.edu
3. Copy each user's UUID
```

### Step 2: Run HOD Setup SQL
```
1. Open database/setup_hod_profiles.sql
2. Replace REPLACE_WITH_AUTH_ID_1 through REPLACE_WITH_AUTH_ID_5 with UUIDs
3. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
4. Paste and run the script
```

### Step 3: Create Technician Accounts
```
1. Create 12 auth accounts in Supabase (see setup_technicians.sql for emails)
2. Copy their UUIDs
3. Update database/setup_technicians.sql
4. Run the SQL script
```

### Step 4: Test the System
```
1. User logs in → Submit complaint with type "Electrical"
2. Login as bg.dabhade@college.edu (Electrical HOD)
3. Verify complaint appears in dashboard
4. Login as other HODs → Verify they DON'T see the electrical complaint
5. Check Technicians tab shows only department technicians
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Example: Electrical Complaint Flow

1. **Student Action:**
   - Opens app → New Complaint
   - Selects type: "Electrical"
   - Fills details → Submit

2. **System Processing:**
   - `departmentMapping.js` maps "electrical" → "Electrical" department
   - `createComplaint()` stores: `complaint_type: "Electrical"`
   - Complaint saved to database

3. **HOD Dashboard:**
   - Mr. B.G. Dabhade (Electrical HOD) logs in
   - `AdminDashboard.js` runs query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM complaints 
     WHERE complaint_type = 'Electrical'
     ```
   - Shows only electrical complaints ✅

4. **Other HODs:**
   - Mr. Chaurdhari (Civil HOD) logs in
   - Same query but with `WHERE complaint_type = 'Civil'`
   - Does NOT see electrical complaint ❌

5. **Technician View:**
   - Query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE department = 'Electrical'`
   - Shows: Suresh, Prakash, Ganesh (only electrical techs) ✅
