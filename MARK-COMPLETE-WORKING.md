## What Changed

### ComplaintDetailScreen.js Updated:

**Before:**
```javascript
onPress: () => {
  // Fake success message
  Alert.alert('Success', 'Work marked as completed!');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
onPress: async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  
  // 1. Upload "after" photo to Supabase storage
  const { data: uploadData } = await uploadCompletionImage(
    complaint.id,
    proofImage
  );
  
  // 2. Update complaint in database
  const { data } = await completeComplaint(complaint.id, {
    notes: 'Work completed by technician',
    imageUrl: uploadData.url,
    imagePath: uploadData.path,
  });
  
  setLoading(false);
  Alert.alert('Success! ‚úÖ', 'Work marked as completed!');
  navigation.goBack();
}
```

## Console Logs to Watch

When marking as complete, you'll see:

```
Starting completion process for complaint: 1
Uploading completion photo...
Uploading completion image for complaint: 1
Completion image uploaded: https://...completed_1_123456.jpg
Photo uploaded successfully: https://...
Marking complaint as completed...
Complaint marked as completed: {...}
```

If error:
```
Upload error: {...}
‚ùå Alert: "Upload Failed"
```

## Database Changes

### Before Marking Complete:
```sql
SELECT id, status, completion_image_url, completed_at 
FROM complaints 
WHERE id = 1;
```

Result:
```
id | status       | completion_image_url | completed_at
1  | in-progress  | null                 | null
```

### After Marking Complete:
```sql
SELECT id, status, completion_image_url, completed_at 
FROM complaints 
WHERE id = 1;
```

Result:
```
id | status    | completion_image_url                        | completed_at
1  | completed | https://.../completed_1_1728220800.jpg      | 2025-10-06 10:30:00
```

## Storage Structure

Both types of photos go in same bucket: `complaint-images`

**Folder structure:**
```
complaint-images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ complaints/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_1728220000.jpg           ‚Üê Original complaint photo
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed_1_1728220800.jpg ‚Üê Completion proof photo
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_1728221000.jpg           ‚Üê Another complaint photo
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ completed_2_1728221900.jpg ‚Üê Another completion photo
```

**Naming convention:**
- Complaint photos: `[complaintId]_[timestamp].jpg`
- Completion photos: `completed_[complaintId]_[timestamp].jpg`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Upload Failed" error
**Possible causes:**
- Storage bucket doesn't allow uploads
- RLS blocking storage writes
- Network issue

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check storage policies
SELECT * FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'complaint-images';

-- If needed, allow uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'complaint-images');
```

### Issue 2: Photo uploads but complaint doesn't move
**Possible causes:**
- RLS blocking complaint UPDATE
- Database column doesn't exist

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Disable RLS (if not done)
ALTER TABLE public.complaints DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'complaints'
AND column_name LIKE 'completion%';
```

### Issue 3: Complaint not appearing in Completed tab
**Possible causes:**
- Status filter not matching
- Data not refreshing

**Fix:**
- Pull down to refresh the Completed tab
- Or logout and login again
