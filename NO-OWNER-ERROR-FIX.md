# ‚úÖ FIX: Storage Permission Error (No Owner Required!)

## The Error

```
ERROR: 42501: must be owner of table objects
```

**What This Means:**
- ‚ùå You can't disable RLS on `storage.objects` (requires superuser)
- ‚úÖ But you CAN create storage policies (no special permissions needed!)

---

## ‚úÖ THE CORRECT FIX (Run This SQL)

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

**File:** `supabase/FIX-STORAGE-WITH-POLICIES.sql`

Or copy this:

```sql
-- 1. Disable RLS on complaints (this works!)
ALTER TABLE public.complaints DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Add completion columns
ALTER TABLE public.complaints 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_image_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completion_image_path TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- 3. Create storage policies (instead of disabling RLS)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "complaint-images upload" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload"
ON storage.objects 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'complaint-images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access"
ON storage.objects 
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'complaint-images');
```

**That's it!** ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ What This Does

### Before (didn't work):
```sql
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ‚ùå Error: must be owner
```

### After (works!):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'complaint-images');
-- ‚úÖ No special permissions needed!
```

**Storage RLS stays enabled**, but now you have a **policy that allows uploads**! üéâ

---

## üß™ Test Again

1. **Reload app** (shake ‚Üí reload)
2. **Login as technician**
3. **Take completion photo**
4. **Mark as complete**
5. **Should work now!** ‚úÖ

---

## üìä Verify Policies Exist

After running the SQL, check:

```sql
SELECT name, action FROM storage.policies 
WHERE bucket_id = 'complaint-images';
```

Should show:
```
name                                  | action
-------------------------------------|--------
Allow authenticated users to upload  | INSERT
Allow public read access             | SELECT
```

If you see these, **it's working!** ‚úÖ

---

## üîç Console Should Show:

```
Uploading completion photo...
Storage upload result: {uploadError: null} ‚úÖ
Photo uploaded successfully!
Marking complaint as completed...
‚úÖ Success!
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Works

**Storage RLS:** 
- Still enabled (we can't disable it)
- But we created policies that allow authenticated users to upload
- So uploads work! ‚úÖ

**Complaints RLS:**
- Disabled (we have permission for this)
- So database updates work! ‚úÖ

**Result:** Both photo upload AND database update work! üéâ

---

## Summary

‚ùå **Don't do this:** `ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`  
   (Requires superuser)

‚úÖ **Do this instead:** `CREATE POLICY ... ON storage.objects`  
   (No special permissions needed!)

**Run `FIX-STORAGE-WITH-POLICIES.sql` and test! üöÄ**
