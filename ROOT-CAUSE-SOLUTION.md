# üéØ ROOT CAUSE FOUND!

## The Real Problem

**Your database has ZERO complaints** (`COUNT(*) = 0`)

This means when you submitted complaints from the user dashboard, they were **BLOCKED from being inserted** into the database by Row Level Security (RLS).

---

## Why Complaints Weren't Saved

Your `complaints` table has this INSERT policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own complaints"
  ON public.complaints FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This policy blocks INSERT if:
1. ‚ùå The user doesn't exist in `public.users` table
2. ‚ùå The `user_id` doesn't match `auth.uid()`
3. ‚ùå User is not properly authenticated

---

## üîß The Complete Fix

### Step 1: Run This SQL

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

**File:** `supabase/FIX-INSERT-BLOCKED.sql`

Or copy this:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS on complaints table
ALTER TABLE public.complaints DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify it's disabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'complaints';
-- Should show: rowsecurity = false
```

This removes the INSERT blocker so complaints can be saved.

---

### Step 2: Test User Can Submit Complaints

1. **Logout** from technician
2. **Login as regular user** (create new account if needed)
3. **Submit a NEW complaint** with:
   - Title: "Test complaint"
   - Type: "electrical"
   - Description: "Testing"
   - Location & Place: Any values
   - **Add a photo**
4. **Check Metro console** - should see "Complaint created successfully"
5. **Check "My Complaints" tab** - complaint should appear there

---

### Step 3: Verify in Database

Run this SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM complaints;
-- Should now show: 1 (or more)

SELECT id, title, status, user_id FROM complaints;
-- Should show your test complaint
```

‚úÖ If you see complaints, success!

---

### Step 4: Check Technician Dashboard

1. **Logout** from user
2. **Login as technician** (technician@test.com / Test@123)
3. **Go to "Assigned Work" tab**
4. **You should NOW see the complaint!** üéâ

---

## Why This Happened

When you first set up the app:
1. ‚úÖ You created the `complaints` table with RLS enabled
2. ‚úÖ You created INSERT policy requiring user_id = auth.uid()
3. ‚ùå But your user account was not properly added to `public.users` table
4. ‚ùå So all INSERT attempts were blocked silently
5. ‚ùå Complaints appeared to submit but never saved to database

By disabling RLS temporarily, we allow INSERTs to work while we fix the user registration.

---

## What the Console Should Show

### When Submitting Complaint (User Dashboard):
```
Submitting complaint with user_id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Complaint created successfully
Image uploaded successfully
```

### When Loading Complaints (Technician Dashboard):
```
üìû getAllComplaints called with status: null
üîç No status filter - getting ALL complaints
üì¶ Supabase response:
  - Data count: 1
‚úÖ Found 1 complaints
‚úÖ Formatted 1 complaints
```

---

## After Testing Successfully

Once complaints work, you can re-enable RLS with proper policies:

```sql
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.complaints ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create better INSERT policy (allows all authenticated users)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create their own complaints" ON public.complaints;
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert complaints"
  ON public.complaints FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create SELECT policy (allows reading all complaints)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own complaints" ON public.complaints;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Technicians can view assigned complaints" ON public.complaints;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all complaints" ON public.complaints;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view all complaints"
  ON public.complaints FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
```

---

**Solution:** 
1. ‚úÖ Disable RLS on complaints table
2. ‚úÖ Submit new complaint as user
3. ‚úÖ Verify complaint saved to database
4. ‚úÖ Check technician dashboard shows it
5. ‚úÖ Re-enable RLS with better policies

**Run `FIX-INSERT-BLOCKED.sql` now and test!** üöÄ
