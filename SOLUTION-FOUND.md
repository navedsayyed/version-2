# 🎯 FOUND THE ISSUE!

## Problem Identified

Your console shows:
```
LOG  Raw Response:
LOG    - Data: []
LOG    - Count: 0
LOG  ⚠️ No complaints found in database
```

**Translation:** The query works perfectly, but returns **0 complaints** with `status = 'in-progress'`.

This means your complaints in the database have a **different status value** than what the app is filtering for!

---

## Why This Happened

You submitted complaints from the user dashboard. They were saved to the database, BUT:

**Option 1:** The status might be `'pending'` instead of `'in-progress'`  
**Option 2:** The status might have extra spaces like `' in-progress '`  
**Option 3:** The status might be `NULL`  
**Option 4:** The database constraint changed the value

## 🔧 The Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Run SQL to Check & Fix Status

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run this file:
- **`supabase/FIX-STATUS-ISSUE.sql`**

Or copy this quick fix:

```sql
-- See what status values exist
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM complaints 
GROUP BY status;

-- Update all complaints to 'in-progress'
UPDATE complaints 
SET status = 'in-progress';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM complaints 
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected result after UPDATE:**
```
status          | count
----------------|-------
in-progress     | 3
```

### Step 2: Reload Your App

```bash
# No need to restart Metro!
# Just reload in Expo Go:
# Shake device → Reload
```

Then login as technician - **you should now see all complaints!** 🎉

## What the SQL Does

1. **Checks current status values** - Shows what's actually in database
2. **Updates ALL complaints** - Sets status to 'in-progress'
3. **Verifies the fix** - Confirms update worked
4. **Tests the query** - Runs exact query the app uses

---

## Why This Works

Your app code is correct! It sets `status: 'in-progress'` when creating complaints.

But something in the database (maybe an old table definition, or manual edits) gave your existing complaints a different status value.

By running the UPDATE, all complaints will have the correct status, and the technician dashboard will see them immediately!

---

## After Running SQL

1. ✅ Run `FIX-STATUS-ISSUE.sql` in Supabase
2. ✅ Check that UPDATE shows "3 rows affected" (or however many complaints you have)
3. ✅ Shake your device → Reload
4. ✅ Login as technician
5. ✅ See all your complaints with photos! 🎉

**Metro console will now show:**
```
LOG  ✅ Found 3 complaints
LOG  ✅ Formatted 3 complaints
LOG  ✅ State updated successfully!
```

---

## Prevention

Going forward, all NEW complaints submitted will automatically have `status = 'in-progress'` because your code is correct. This fix is only for existing complaints that somehow got a different status value!
