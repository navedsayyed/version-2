fab: {
  bottom: 90,  // Moved up from 24
  zIndex: 999, // Added to ensure visibility
  elevation: 8 // Increased from 6
}
```

**Result:** The blue (+) button should now be visible above the bottom navigation

### Fix 2: Debug Logging Added
**Location:** Console/Terminal where Expo runs

**What to check:**
```
=== HOD PROFILE ===
HOD Department: IT (or Civil, Electrical, Mechanical)
HOD Role: admin
HOD Full Name: Your Name

=== LOADING TECHNICIANS ===
Department: IT
All technicians in database: [array]
Technicians for this department: [filtered array]
Number of technicians found: 0 (or actual count)
```

---

## üîç DIAGNOSIS STEPS

### Step 1: Check Console Logs

1. **Reload the app** (shake phone ‚Üí reload, or press R in terminal)
2. **Check terminal/console** for debug output
3. **Look for:**
   - What department does admin have?
   - How many total technicians exist?
   - Do technicians match the department?

### Step 2: Verify Button Visibility

After reloading:
- Look at **bottom-right corner** of Technicians screen
- Should see a **blue circular button** with **+** icon
- Button should be **above** the bottom navigation bar

### Step 3: Check Database

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Check all technicians
SELECT email, full_name, role, department 
FROM public.users 
WHERE role = 'technician';

-- Check IT department specifically
SELECT email, full_name, role, department 
FROM public.users 
WHERE role = 'technician' AND department = 'IT';
```

## üêõ POSSIBLE ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Department Name Mismatch ‚ùå

**Symptom:** Console shows different department names

Example:
```
Admin has: "IT"
Technicians have: "Information Technology"
OR
Admin has: "IT"
Technicians have: "it" (lowercase)
```

**Solution:** Make department names **EXACTLY** match (case-sensitive!)

Fix admin:
```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET department = 'IT'
WHERE id = 'your-admin-id';
```

Fix technicians:
```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET department = 'IT'
WHERE role = 'technician' AND department ILIKE '%it%';
```

### Issue 2: No Technicians Exist ‚ùå

**Symptom:** 
```

Number of technicians found: 0
```

**Solution:** Add technicians using the app!

2. **Fill form:**
   - Full Name: Rajesh Kumar
   - Email: rajesh.it@test.com
   - Phone: 9876543210
   - Password: test123
3. **Click "Add Technician"**
4. **Share credentials** with technician

**Alternative:** Add via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to **Authentication ‚Üí Users**
2. Click **"Add User"**
3. Enter:
   - Email: tech1@test.com
   - Password: test123456
   - Confirm password
4. Click **"Create User"**

### Issue 3: Wrong Role ‚ùå

**Symptom:** Users exist but not showing

**Check:**
```sql

UPDATE public.users 
SET role = 'technician'
WHERE email = 'tech@example.com';
```

SELECT email, department FROM public.users WHERE role = 'technician';
```

```

But you're logged in as **IT Admin**!

**Solution:** Reassign technicians
```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET department = 'IT'
WHERE email IN ('tech1@test.com', 'tech2@test.com');
```

### Issue 5: Auth Account Missing ‚ùå

## üö® EMERGENCY FIX

If nothing works, run this SQL to add a test technician directly:

```sql
-- 1. First create auth account in Supabase Dashboard:
--    Authentication ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add User
--    Email: test.tech@example.com
--    Password: test123456

-- 2. Then run this (replace 'YOUR_ADMIN_DEPARTMENT' with your actual department):
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, phone, role, department)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test.tech@example.com'),
  'test.tech@example.com',
  'Test Technician',
  '1234567890',
  'technician',
  'IT'  -- Change to: Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical if needed
);
```

## üìù WHAT TO SHARE

If still not working, share:

1. **Console logs** (copy entire output)
