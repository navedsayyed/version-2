## User Flow

### Viewing In-Progress Complaint:
1. User opens "My Complaints" tab
2. Switches to "In Progress" tab
3. Clicks on any complaint card
4. Sees detail view with:
   - Their original photo
   - Current status
   - Message that work is being done

### Viewing Completed Complaint:
1. User opens "My Complaints" tab
2. Switches to "Completed" tab
3. Clicks on completed complaint card
4. Sees full detail view with:
   - Before photo (their submission)

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation:
```javascript
// In UserDashboard.js - Make card clickable
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigation.navigate('UserComplaintDetail', { complaint: c })}>
  <Card>...</Card>
</TouchableOpacity>

// In App.js - Register screen
<Stack.Screen name="UserComplaintDetail" component={UserComplaintDetailScreen} />
```

### Data Flow:
```javascript
// Fetch complaints with completion data
completedImage: complaint.completion_image_url || null
completedAt: complaint.completed_at ? new Date(...) : null
completedNotes: complaint.completion_notes || null

// Pass to detail screen
navigation.navigate('UserComplaintDetail', { complaint })

// Display based on status
{complaint.status === 'completed' && complaint.completedImage ? (
  // Show before & after photos
) : (
  // Show in-progress message
)}
```

### Smart Display Logic:
- If `status === 'completed'` AND `completedImage` exists:
  - Show "Before & After Photos" section
  - Display both user's photo and technician's photo
  - Show completion date and notes
- If `status === 'in-progress'`:
  - Show only user's original photo
  - Show "Work In Progress" message
  - Explain they'll see completion photos later

## Benefits for Users

âœ… **Proof**: Before/after photos provide visual evidence
âœ… **Communication**: Technician notes explain the resolution
âœ… **Tracking**: Can see both submission and completion dates

## Files Changed

1. âœ… `screens/UserDashboard.js` - Made cards clickable, added completion data
