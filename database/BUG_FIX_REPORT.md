# 🐛 Bug Fix - "Technician has no department assigned"

## ✅ Issue Found and Fixed!

### **Root Cause:**
The code was calling `getCurrentUser()` and `getUserProfile()` **incorrectly**. These functions return objects like `{ user, error }` and `{ data, error }`, but the code was treating them as direct values.

---

## 🔧 Files Fixed:

### 1. **TechnicianDashboard.js** ✅
**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
const { user } = await getCurrentUser();  // ✅ This was correct
const profile = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ❌ WRONG!
const technicianDepartment = profile.department;  // ❌ profile is undefined
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
const { user } = await getCurrentUser();  // ✅ Correct
const { data: profileData, error: profileError } = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ✅ Fixed!
const technicianDepartment = profileData.department;  // ✅ Now works!
```

---

### 2. **CompletedWorkScreen.js** ✅
**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
const user = await getCurrentUser();  // ❌ Missing destructuring!
const profile = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ❌ user is an object {user, error}!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
const { user } = await getCurrentUser();  // ✅ Fixed!
const { data: profile, error: profileError } = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ✅ Fixed!
```

---

### 3. **TechnicianProfileScreen.js** ✅
**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
const user = await getCurrentUser();  // ❌ Missing destructuring!
const userProfile = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ❌ Wrong!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```javascript
const { user } = await getCurrentUser();  // ✅ Fixed!
const { data: userProfile, error: profileError } = await getUserProfile(user.id);  // ✅ Fixed!
```

## 📊 What Was Happening:

### **Before Fix:**
1. `getCurrentUser()` returned: `{ user: {...}, error: null }`
2. Code did: `const user = await getCurrentUser()`
3. So `user` was actually: `{ user: {...}, error: null }`
4. Then code tried: `getUserProfile(user.id)` 
5. But `user.id` was **undefined** because `user` was an object, not the user!
6. Profile loading failed silently
7. `profile.department` was undefined
8. Error: "Technician has no department assigned"

### **After Fix:**
1. `getCurrentUser()` returns: `{ user: {...}, error: null }`
2. Code does: `const { user } = await getCurrentUser()` ✅
3. Now `user` is the actual user object: `{ id: '123...', email: '...' }`
4. Code does: `const { data: profile } = await getUserProfile(user.id)` ✅
5. Profile loads successfully ✅
6. `profile.department` returns: "Electrical" ✅
7. No error! ✅

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

1. **Stop your Expo server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Restart the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Clear Metro bundler cache** (press `Shift+M` in terminal, then select "Clear cache")
4. **Login as a technician:**
   - Email: `suresh.patil@tech.com`
   - Password: `Tech@1234`
5. **Check Profile Tab:**
   - Should show "Electrical" department ✅
   - Should show real name, email, phone ✅
   - No more dummy data ✅
6. **Check Assigned Tab:**
   - Should show complaints (or empty if none) ✅
   - No error message ✅
7. **Check console logs:**
   - Look for: `📋 Profile loaded:` with full profile data
   - Look for: `🏢 Technician department: Electrical`

---

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### ✅ What You Should See:
- **Profile Tab:** Shows real technician data with department badge
- **Assigned Tab:** Shows complaints from technician's department only
- **Completed Tab:** Shows completed complaints from department only
- **Console:** No error messages about missing department
- **Console:** See `📋 Profile loaded:` with full profile object
- **Console:** See `🏢 Technician department: Electrical`

### ❌ What You Should NOT See:
- ❌ "Technician has no department assigned"
- ❌ Dummy data (John Doe, fake email)
- ❌ Profile loading errors
- ❌ Complaints from other departments

---

## 🔍 Additional Debugging:

If you still see issues, check the console for these new debug logs:

```javascript
📋 Profile loaded: { id: '...', email: '...', department: 'Electrical', ... }
❌ Profile error: null
🏢 Technician department: Electrical
📊 Full profile object: { ... }
```

If you see:
- `📋 Profile loaded: null` → Database issue, profile doesn't exist
- `❌ Profile error: {...}` → Database query error
- `🏢 Technician department: undefined` → Department column is NULL in database

---

## 📝 Summary:

**The bug was a JavaScript destructuring issue**, not a database issue! 

The functions were returning objects with nested data:
- `getCurrentUser()` → `{ user: {...}, error }`
- `getUserProfile()` → `{ data: {...}, error }`

The code needed to **destructure** these properly:
```javascript
const { user } = await getCurrentUser();
const { data: profile, error } = await getUserProfile(user.id);
```

Now all three technician screens work correctly! 🚀
